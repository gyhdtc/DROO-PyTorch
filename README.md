# DROO

*Deep Reinforcement Learning for Online Computation Offloading in Wireless Powered Mobile-Edge Computing Networks*

Python code to reproduce our DROO algorithm for Wireless-powered Mobile-Edge Computing [1], which uses the time-varying wireless channel gains as the input and generates the binary offloading decisions. It includes:

- [memory.py](memory.py): the DROO structure for the WPMEC, inclduing building DNN, storing data sample, Training DNN, and generating quantized binary offloading decisions.
- [optimizatin.py](optimization.py): Solve the resource allocation problem.

- [data](./data): all data are stored in this subdirectory, includes:

  - **data_#.mat**: training and testing data sets, where # = {10, 20, 30} is the user number

- [main.py](main.py): run this file for DROO, including setting system parameters

- [demo_alternate_weights.py](demo_alternate_weights.py): run this file to evaluate the performance of DROO when WDs' weights are alternated

- [demo_on_off.py](demo_on_off.py): run this file to evaluate the performance of DROO when some WDs are randomly turning on/off
